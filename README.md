Description
-----------
In this repository you have a simple implementation of the command interpreter for the system to 
receive standard commands (Simple Shell) this version has characteristics similar to some aspects 
of the shell standard.

<ol>
	<li>The shell breaks the input into tokens: words and operators; see Token Recognition.</li>
	<li>The shell parses the input into simple commands.</li>
	<li>The shell performs various expansions (separately) on different parts of each command, resulting in a list of pathnames and fields to be treated as a command and arguments.</li>
	<li>The shell executes a function, built-in, executable file, or scripts</li>
	<li>The shell optionally waits for the command to complete and collects the exit status.</li>
</ol>

pwd -
